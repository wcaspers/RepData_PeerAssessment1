## Loading and preprocessing the data
```r
library(dplyr)
library(chron)
library(ggplot2)

if(!file.exists('activity.csv')){
  unzip("zipfile.zip", files = NULL, list = FALSE, overwrite = TRUE,
        junkpaths = FALSE, exdir = ".", unzip = "internal",
        setTimes = FALSE)
}
activity <-read.csv("./activity.csv",header=TRUE)
```
##### 2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```r
by_day <- group_by(activity, date)


```

-----

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```r
act_sum_steps <- summarize(by_day, sum_steps = sum(steps))

```

##### 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```r

hist(act_sum_steps$sum_steps, breaks=20,  main="Histogram of daily steps", 
     xlab= "Total number of steps taken each day", xlim = c(0,25000), ylim = c(0,12))
     
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5.png) 

##### 2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```r
mean(act_sum_steps$sum_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(act_sum_steps$sum_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
* Mean:10766.19
* Median:  10765

-----

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```r
averageStepsPerTimeBlock <- aggregate(x=list(meanSteps=activityData$steps), by=list(interval=activityData$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```

##### 1. Make a time series plot

```r
by_int <- group_by(activity, interval)
act_avg_steps  <- summarize(by_int, avg_steps = mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE)) 
plot( act_avg_steps$interval, act_avg_steps$avg_steps,type = "l", 
            xlab="5-minute intervals during the day",
            ylab ="average number of steps taken",
            main="Number of Steps per day (averaged over days) ")

```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8](figure/unnamed-chunk-8.png) 

##### 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```r
max_avg_steps  <- max(act_avg_steps$avg_steps))
act_avg_steps[act_avg_steps$avg_steps == max(act_avg_steps$avg_steps),]
```

* Most Steps at Interval: 835

----

## Imputing missing values
##### 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 

```r
Missing_value <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
Missing_value") +
  theme_bw()
```

* Number of missing values: 2304

##### 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
Missing values are replaced by the average steps of its interval value

##### 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```r
index1  <- which(!is.na(activity$steps))
index2  <- which(is.na(activity$steps))
activity_new1 <- activity[index1,]
activity_new2 <- activity[index2,]
activity_new2 <- merge(activity_new2,act_avg_steps, by="interval")
activity_new2 <- activity_new2[,c(1,3,4)]
names(activity_new2)[3] <- c("steps")
activity_new   <- rbind(activity_new1, activity_new2)
```


##### 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day 

```r
by_day_new <- group_by(activity_new, date)
act_sum_steps <- summarize(by_day_new, sum_steps = sum(steps))
hist(act_sum_steps$sum_steps, breaks=20,  main="Histogram of daily steps-missing values filled", 
     xlab= "Total number of steps taken each day", xlim = c(0,25000), ylim = c(0,22))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12](figure/unnamed-chunk-12.png) 

##### ... and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 

```r
mean(act_sum_steps$sum_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(act_sum_steps$sum_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
* Mean:10766.19
* Median: 10766.19

* Replacing the missing values by its intervall values reduces the variance and centers the 
* data set around its mean.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
##### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


```r
activity_new   <- cbind(activity_new, is.weekend(activity_new$date))
names(activity_new)[4] <- c("weekend")

by_int <- group_by(activity_new, interval, weekend)
act_avg_steps  <- summarize(by_int, avg_steps = mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE))
```

##### 2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot


```r

  ggplot(act_avg_steps, aes(x=interval, y=avg_steps)) + 
  geom_line(color="black") + 
  facet_wrap(~ weekend, nrow=2, ncol=1) +
  labs(x="5-minute intervals during the day, Weekend = TRUE / False",
   y="average number of steps taken") +
   theme_bw()
```
